Some features require membership and some features are available for free to any user. In this FAQ you will find the answers to frequently asked questions - but if you still have a question that you cannot find an answer to, please create a ticket and we will try to get you started as soon as possible.",
    "0-1-title": "The menu",
    "0-1-body": "You can find the menu at the top of the page. This consists of a number of parts, such as the search field that you can use to search within each page. And on the right side you see the user menu, printing, notifications and full screen. With the user menu you can go to your account / profile settings, your subscription, invoices and tickets. We will go into more detail on each part later in this FAQ, but for now we will continue with the buttons print, notifications and full screen. You can use the print button to print invoices, tickets and other pages, for example. The notifications button provides a menu where all notifications are displayed for you. For example, you will find notifications about your subscription, changes to your playlists or other things that are important to you. The full screen button does exactly what it says, you can use it to quickly switch between full screen and have the most available space on your screen.",
    "0-2-title": "The navigation bar",
    "0-2-body": "You will find the navigation bar on the left. You use these to navigate to the playlists, dashboards, overviews and all other functions available for your subscription. You can hide this with the button you find in the menu on the left, so you can enlarge the workspace even further if you want.",
    "0-3-title": "Use on mobile devices",
    "0-3-body": "We also try to support the use of mobile devices. Although most functions can be used on a SmartPhone or Tablet for example, we still recommend editing playlists and using the advanced functions on a Laptop or PC. Because a PC or Laptop has a larger screen and a mouse available, you will have the best user experience.",
    "0-4-title": "Contact",
    "0-4-body": "You can contact us in various ways. The easiest way is to create a support ticket. When you create a support ticket you can choose which department your question or comment is directed to, and you can choose a priority. This ensures that we can respond more quickly to urgent questions and that we can find a solution faster. You can of course always send an email, although you should keep in mind that replying to an email will usually take longer than a support ticket.",
    "1-0-title": "My account",
    "1-0-body": "Your account consists of a username and password. You use this to log in to IPTV Tools and perhaps also within some applications. A profile is linked to your account, we will discuss this in more detail in this FAQ. Your subscription is also linked to your account if you have purchased it. You can cancel your account at any time from your profile. Please note that when you cancel your account, all associated information such as your profile, invoices, subscriptions and support tickets will be deleted.",
    "1-1-title": "My profile",
    "1-1-body": "Your profile contains information such as your name, address, and contact details. You can also find within your profile when you became a member and when your subscription expires. You can also change your password here. You are not obliged to fill in the information on the profile or to provide correct information. This information is only used for correspondence and for invoices. The information on your profile is in no way shared with third parties and is stored in a secure manner. ",
    "1-2-title": "My email-address",
    "1-2-body": "As indicated, you are not required to provide an email address, or to provide a correct email address. But keep in mind that we use this email address in case you can no longer log in and want to reset your password. If no email address is provided but a phone number is provided, we can recover your account based on verification via your phone number. If neither of these is available, we cannot recover your account, and the costs incurred for subscriptions, among other things, are entirely for the user.",
    "2-0-title": "My subscription",
    "2-0-body": "Your membership consists of a prepaid subscription. You therefore pay for a period of your choice. If you switch from a higher account to a lower account, your remaining days will be carried over to your new subscription. If you renew your current subscription, the remaining days will also be added. If you switch from a lower plan to a higher plan, the remaining days will not be included. If you still have a lot of days to spare and still want to take them with you, you can always create a support ticket and we will calculate how many days you can take with you converted to your new subscription.",
    "2-1-title": "Canceling",
    "2-1-body": "If you want to cancel your subscription before the end of your subscription, you can create a support ticket. We will then cancel your current subscription for you. Pay attention! We do not make refunds, so if you cancel your subscription prematurely, you are not entitled to a refund.",
    "2-2-title": "Vacation",
    "2-2-body": "When you go on holiday or are away from home for a longer period - we can pause your subscription for you. This means that you do not pay for the subscription during the period of your absence and cannot use the functions that come with the subscription. If you return earlier and want to activate your subscription earlier, you can contact us. For more information or to request a break from your subscription, you can create a support ticket for the administration department.",
    "2-3-title": "Private or Business",
    "2-3-body": "Not sure what to choose? Private is mainly aimed at people who use IPTV in their private situation, at home or at the campsite. Business is primarily intended for individuals who sell or manage IPTV for clients. As a private customer with high requirements you can of course also purchase a business subscription. If you still need more features, larger playlists, or more space - you can always contact us for a customized subscription.",
    "2-4-title": "Pricing",
    "2-4-body": "Our prices are not fixed and may change as the number of functions and the complexity of certain functions increase. We try to offer as much functionality as possible for the lowest possible price, but this may mean that our prices are adjusted once or a few times a year. The price for subscriptions applies at the time of purchase, so if you take out a subscription for a year or longer, it is very possible that you will end up cheaper than if you renew per month. As a customer you are always entitled to all new functions within the subscription. The start date of your subscription is therefore independent of this.",
    "2-5-title": "Tests",
    "2-5-body": "If you would like to test one before purchasing a subscription, you can send us a support ticket. Each user is entitled to 7 days of testing a subscription of their choice. After these 7 days you can choose to extend the subscription or to stop it. If you do not renew the tested subscription, you will no longer have access to the functions associated with the subscription. Also, the playlists used in the test will be deleted if the subscription is not renewed.",
    "3-0-title": "My details",
    "3-0-body": "We are extremely careful with your personal data. Your personal information is not shared with third parties and is stored securely in a secure environment. Your data will only be used for contact and to recover your account in the event of loss of your password.",
    "3-1-title": "Retrieving data",
    "3-1-body": "In the event that a third party would request data from our users, all personal data will be destroyed. We do this to guarantee our users 100% security. We do not offer (illegal) content ourselves, but will do everything to secure the data of our customers. We take no responsibility for the content available through our users' playlists. As a user, you must ensure that the content available in the playlist is legal in the country where you live.",
    "3-2-title": "BREIN Foundation",
    "3-2-body": "We have no accountability whatsoever to the BREIN foundation. We do not offer any content ourselves - and only offer options to adjust playlists and request content. If you live in a country where the BREIN foundation has authority, you are responsible for the content available in the playlists, and we (IPTV-Tools) cannot be held responsible in any way. We do not control playlist sources, and we are not affiliated with IPTV providers.",
    "3-3-title": "Illegal content",
