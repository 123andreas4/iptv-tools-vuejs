The term “dispute” means any\n              dispute, action, or other controversy between you and IPTV-Tools\n              concerning the Services or this agreement, whether in contract,\n              warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal\n              or equitable basis. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible\n              meaning allowable under law.\n            </p>\n            <h1>Notice of Dispute</h1>\n            <p>\n              In the event of a dispute, you or IPTV-Tools must give the other a\n              Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth\n              the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it,\n              the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested.\n              You must send any Notice of Dispute via email to:\n              <a href=\"mailto:ernst@erdesigns.eu\">ernst@erdesigns.eu</a>.\n              IPTV-Tools will send any Notice of Dispute to you by mail to your\n              address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address.

You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate\n              in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a\n              judge or jury. The dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration\n              in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the\n              American Arbitration Association. Either party may seek any\n              interim or preliminary injunctive relief from any court of\n              competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party’s rights\n              or property pending the completion of arbitration.
